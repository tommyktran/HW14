Recursion exercises taken from https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs9/lectures/06/Recursion%20Problems.pdf

14a. Suppose you have n doctors, each of which are free for a certain number of hours per day,
and  m  patients, each of whom needs to be seen for a certain number of hours. Write a
function that determines whether it's possible for all the patients to be scheduled so that
none of the doctors spends more time than they have available. Better yet, tell us which
people should see which doctors.

14b. You have a collection of cell phone towers, each represented by an (x, y) coordinate in the
plane. Each cell phone tower needs to be assigned a transmitting frequency chosen from a
list of k different frequencies. The only requirement is that no two towers within distance
d of one another can be assigned the same frequency, since that would cause interference.
Determine whether it's possible to assign the cell towers the frequencies so that no two
towers overlap. If you can, tell us what frequencies get assigned to which towers.
